# RBAC Implementation - Fixed

## Issue Identified

The navigation menu was showing all routes to all users regardless of their role. While the database RLS policies were correctly configured, the frontend was not enforcing role-based access control.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Permissions Module (`src/lib/permissions.ts`)

Centralized role-based access control configuration:

```typescript
{
  path: '/upload',
  label: 'Upload',
  allowedRoles: ['compliance_officer', 'compliance_manager']
}
```

**Route Access Matrix:**

| Route | Allowed Roles |
|-------|--------------|
| `/dashboard` | All roles |
| `/upload` | Compliance Officer, Compliance Manager |
| `/processing` | Compliance Officer, Compliance Manager, CCO, Internal Auditor |
| `/review` | Compliance Officer, Compliance Manager, CCO, Internal Auditor |
| `/search` | Compliance Officer, Compliance Manager, CCO, CISO, Internal Auditor, DPO, External Auditor |
| `/analytics` | Compliance Manager, CCO, CISO, Internal Auditor, DPO, External Auditor |
| `/bulk` | Compliance Manager, CCO |

### 2. Updated Navigation Component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)

- Now uses `getAccessibleRoutes(user.role_name)` to filter menu items
- Only shows routes the user has permission to access
- Dynamically renders navigation based on role

### 3. Created RoleGuard Component (`src/components/RoleGuard.tsx`)

- Wraps each protected route
- Checks if user's role is in the `allowedRoles` array
- Shows "Access Denied" message if unauthorized
- Prevents direct URL access to restricted routes

### 4. Updated App Routes (`src/App.tsx`)

Each route now has double protection:
1. **ProtectedRoute** - Ensures user is authenticated
2. **RoleGuard** - Ensures user has the required role

Example:
```typescript
<Route
  path="/upload"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <RoleGuard allowedRoles={['compliance_officer', 'compliance_manager']}>
        <DocumentUpload />
      </RoleGuard>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Frontend Navigation
- Navigation menu only shows accessible routes
- Improves UX by not showing unavailable options

### Layer 2: Frontend Route Guards
- RoleGuard prevents route access even with direct URL
- Shows clear error message for unauthorized access

### Layer 3: Database RLS Policies
- Row-Level Security enforced at database level
- Prevents data access even if frontend is bypassed
- Already configured correctly (no changes needed)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Compliance Officer Access
1. Login: `officer@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Upload, Processing, Review, Search
3. **Should NOT see:** Analytics, Bulk
4. Try accessing `/analytics` directly → Access Denied

### Test Compliance Manager Access
1. Login: `manager@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Upload, Processing, Review, Search, Analytics, Bulk
3. Full access to operational features

### Test CCO Access
1. Login: `cco@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Processing, Review, Search, Analytics, Bulk
3. **Should NOT see:** Upload (oversight role, not operational)

### Test CISO Access
1. Login: `ciso@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Search, Analytics
3. **Should NOT see:** Upload, Processing, Review, Bulk
4. Security monitoring focus

### Test System Admin Access
1. Login: `admin@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard only
3. System admin manages users, not documents

### Test ML Engineer Access
1. Login: `mlengineer@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard only
3. ML Engineer manages models, not documents

### Test Internal Auditor Access
1. Login: `auditor@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Processing, Review, Search, Analytics
3. Comprehensive audit access (read-only)

### Test DPO Access
1. Login: `dpo@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Search, Analytics
3. Privacy compliance monitoring

### Test External Auditor Access
1. Login: `external@demo.com` / `demo123`
2. **Should see:** Dashboard, Search, Analytics
3. External audit access (read-only)

## Verification Checklist

✅ Navigation menu filters routes by role
✅ Direct URL access blocked for unauthorized routes
✅ Clear error message shown for access denial
✅ Database RLS policies remain intact
✅ Build succeeds without errors
✅ All route guards properly configured

## Role Permissions Summary

### Operational Roles
- **Compliance Officer:** Can upload, process, review documents (own scope)
- **Compliance Manager:** Can upload, process, review, approve, bulk process (team scope)

### Executive Roles
