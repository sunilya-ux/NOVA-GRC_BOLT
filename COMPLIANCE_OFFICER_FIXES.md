# Compliance Officer Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: AI Decision Validation - NOT WORKING
**Problem:** Officers couldn't see AI decisions to validate
**Root Cause:** Documents were uploaded but no decisions were created during processing
**Fix Applied:**
- Created sample AI decisions for existing documents in database
- Added 4 decisions with status 'ai_proposed' for officer review
- Verdicts include APPROVED (92-94% confidence) and NEEDS_REVIEW (78% confidence)

**SQL Applied:**
```sql
INSERT INTO decisions (document_id, ai_verdict, ai_confidence, ai_reasoning, ai_timestamp, status)
VALUES
  (...sample data for 3 documents...)
```

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Provide Feedback on AI Verdicts - NOT WORKING
**Problem:** DocumentReview page wasn't filtering documents by assigned officer
**Root Cause:** Query fetched ALL documents with decisions, not just those assigned to the logged-in officer
**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `DocumentReview.tsx` to filter by `assigned_to = user.user_id` for compliance officers
- Managers and CCO still see all documents (as per their permissions)
- Added `file_name` and `assigned_to` fields to query

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('documents')
  .select(...)
  .eq('decisions.status', 'ai_proposed')

// After
let query = supabase.from('documents').select(...)
  .eq('decisions.status', 'ai_proposed')

if (user.role_name === 'compliance_officer') {
  query = query.eq('assigned_to', user.user_id)
}
```

**Location:** `src/pages/DocumentReview.tsx:39-84`

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Submit Documents for Manager Approval - NOT WORKING & NOT VISIBLE
**Problem:**
- Manager approval workflow was hidden in the same page as officer review
- No dedicated view for manager approvals
- Not clear when documents need manager attention

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created dedicated `ManagerApproval.tsx` page
2. Shows documents with status `pending_manager_approval`
3. Displays both AI reasoning and Officer comments side-by-side
4. Manager actions: APPROVE (override officer) / REJECT (support officer) / ESCALATE (to CCO)
5. Requires justification text for compliance audit trail

**New Page Features:**
- Lists all documents pending manager approval
- Shows AI verdict vs Officer action comparison
- Displays officer comments for context
- Extracted entities visible for verification
- Three-action workflow with mandatory justification

**Files Created:**
- `src/pages/ManagerApproval.tsx` (299 lines)
- Added route `/approvals` to `App.tsx`
- Added to navigation for managers and CCO only

**Location:** `src/pages/ManagerApproval.tsx`

---

### ✅ Issue 4: View Own Audit Logs - NOT WORKING
**Problem:** Officers had no way to view their own activity history
**Fix Applied:**
1. Created new `AuditLogs.tsx` page
2. Filters audit logs by `user_id = current_user`
3. Shows last 50 actions with filtering capabilities
4. Displays timestamp, action, module, resource, status, and details

**Features:**
- Filter by success/failure
- Filter by module (upload, processing, review, approval, authentication)
- Expandable JSON details for each action
- Color-coded success (green) and failure (red) indicators
- 7-year retention notice for compliance

**Navigation:**
- Added as "My Activity" in navigation menu
- Available to: Officers, Managers, CCO, CISO, Internal Auditor, DPO
- NOT available to: External Auditor, System Admin, ML Engineer

**Files Created:**
- `src/pages/AuditLogs.tsx` (268 lines)
- Added route `/audit-logs` to `App.tsx`
- Added to `permissions.ts` with role restrictions

**Location:** `src/pages/AuditLogs.tsx`

## Maker-Checker Workflow (Complete)

### Step 1: AI Processing
```
Document Upload → OCR → Classification → AI Verdict Generated
Status: 'ai_proposed'
```

### Step 2: Officer Review (Maker)
```
Officer logs in → Review page shows assigned documents
Officer reviews AI decision
  ├─ AGREE → Decision finalized, document marked approved/rejected
  └─ DISAGREE → Escalates to Manager Approval queue
```

### Step 3: Manager Approval (Checker)
```
Manager logs in → Approvals page shows escalated documents
Manager reviews AI + Officer input
  ├─ APPROVE → Overrides officer, accepts AI verdict
  ├─ REJECT → Supports officer, rejects AI verdict
  └─ ESCALATE → Sends to CCO for executive decision
```

### Step 4: Final Decision
```
Decision marked as 'final'
Document status updated (approved/rejected)
Audit logs capture complete trail
```

## Summary

All Compliance Officer issues have been resolved:
