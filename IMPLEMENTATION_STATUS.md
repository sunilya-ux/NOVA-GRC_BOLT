## 📊 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

**Overall Completion: ~30%**

- ✅ **Infrastructure:** 90% complete (Auth, DB, RBAC, UI framework)
- ⚠️ **Business Logic:** 10% complete (Mostly placeholders)
- ❌ **AI Integration:** 0% complete (Not connected)
- ❌ **File Processing:** 0% complete (No storage setup)
- ✅ **Security:** 80% complete (RLS configured, need MFA)

**What Works:**
- Login and logout
- Role-based navigation
- Protected routes
- Database structure

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Document upload (no storage)
- AI processing (no API calls)
- Search (no Pinecone)
- Analytics (no real data)
- Bulk operations (no implementation)

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

To make this a functional application, you need to implement:

1. **Document Upload to Supabase Storage** (1-2 hours)
2. **OpenAI OCR Integration** (2-3 hours)
3. **Pinecone Vector Search** (2-3 hours)
4. **Decision Workflow** (3-4 hours)
5. **Real Dashboard Analytics** (2-3 hours)

**Total Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours of development

## 📝 NOTES

- The frontend is well-structured and ready for backend integration
- Database schema is complete and properly secured with RLS
- RBAC is fully functional
- Authentication works correctly
- The main gap is **connecting the UI to actual business logic**
