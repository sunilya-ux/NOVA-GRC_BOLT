   - **Officer Comment:** Why officer disagreed
   - **Extracted Information:** Document entities

### Step 4: Make Final Decision
1. Select Manager Action:
   - **APPROVE** → Override officer, accept AI verdict
   - **REJECT** → Support officer, reject AI verdict
   - **ESCALATE** → Send to CCO for executive decision
2. Add justification (required for audit compliance)
3. Click "Submit Decision"
4. Document is finalized

## If You Still See Issues

### Issue: Blank Screen / "Your preview will appear here"
**Cause:** Dev server is starting
**Solution:** Wait 5-10 seconds, page should load automatically

### Issue: Login page loads but after login shows error
**Cause:** Browser cache has old authentication state
**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Storage → Clear Site Data
3. Refresh page
4. Login again

### Issue: Navigation links missing
**Cause:** Browser cached old build
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Or open in Incognito/Private window

### Issue: Review page shows "No documents"
**Cause:** RLS filtering or no decisions in database
**Solution:**
1. Check you're logged in as officer@demo.com
2. Run SQL query from COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_FIXES.md to verify decisions exist
3. Documents should be assigned_to the officer user_id

---

## Quick Database Verification

If you need to verify the database state, run:

```sql
-- Check decisions exist and are assigned correctly
SELECT
  d.document_id,
  d.document_type,
  d.status as doc_status,
  dec.ai_verdict,
  dec.status as decision_status,
  u.email as assigned_to
FROM documents d
JOIN decisions dec ON d.document_id = dec.document_id
JOIN users u ON d.assigned_to = u.user_id
WHERE dec.status IN ('ai_proposed', 'pending_manager_approval')
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;
```

Should return at least 5 rows.

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you verify the workflows are working:

1. **Test with Real Data**
   - Upload actual documents
   - Trigger AI processing (will need valid OpenAI/Pinecone keys)
   - Review real AI classifications

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with 100+ documents
   - Verify pagination works
   - Check query performance

3. **Security Testing**
   - Verify officers can't see other officers' documents
   - Verify managers can approve/reject
   - Test RLS policies thoroughly

4. **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**
   - Have real compliance officers test workflows
   - Get feedback on UI/UX
   - Identify edge cases
